# 🔍 Findings: LAVRS Market

## 🔍 Critical Constraints
- **Manual Control**: Automation must support, not replace, human curation.
- **Czech Standards**: Invoices must comply with local accounting laws.
- **Ephemeral Reservations**: approved apps expire strictly after 5 days without payment.
- **Privacy**: Exhibition layout (map) is admin-only.
- **Prototyping Focus**: Project will lead with UI/UX prototyping using mock data; DB/API connections deferred.
